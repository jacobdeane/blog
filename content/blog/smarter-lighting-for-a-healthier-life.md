No matter what you have done today before reading this post, you have been massively exposed to something that constantly influences you. It affects your sleep, your concentration, alertness and can profoundly affect your health. Light has a bigger influence on your wellbeing than you probably realise.

For many years lighting has generally been chosen based on installation and running costs and offered very little control over colour and brightness. Itâ€™s only fairly recently that the development of LED lights has given us the ability to easily control the colour of lights in our homes, not just the brightness.

For me the biggest attraction of smart lighting is not being able to turn lights on from my phone from half-way around the world, nor shouting at a voice assistant to turn up the lights in the kitchen; its the ability to be able to tune the temperature of white light around my house to suit different times of day.

Its certainly not the flashiest feature, but having the right colour temperature lighting is very important to health and happiness. *(I do have a disco mode in my toilet for showing off to friends.)*
