Part of the North American Nebula imaged over 5 or 6 nights in July & August. Finally found some time to process this incredible nebula. The North America Nebula is large, covering an area of more than four times the size of the full moon. The region in the top right of the image is known as the Cygnus Wall.

This was imaged using narrowband filters for Ha, OIII and SII emissions. Shot with an ASI1600mm pro camera, though a William Optics ZS61 on a Losmandy G11 mount. Controlled with Sequence Generator Pro and autoguided with PHD2.
