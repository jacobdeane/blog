My first time imaging with a narrowband filter. This image is taken using a Hydrogen Alpha filter designed to only allow a very narrow wavelength of light through. This allows for longer exposures and increased detail in the dust of space.

This image is made up of 43 x 5 minute exposures in Hydrogen Alpha, 3 hours & 35 minutes total exposure. I had to do quite a bit of noise reduction, and it could definitely be improved by stacking a lot more subframes!
