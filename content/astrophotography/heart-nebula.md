description: >-
  The Heart Nebula, IC 1805, Sharpless 2-190, lies some 7500 light years away
  from Earth and is located in the Perseus Arm of the Galaxy in the
  constellation Cassiopeia. It was discovered by William Herschel on 3 November
  1787. It is an emission nebula showing glowing ionized hydrogen gas and darker
  dust lanes.


  The brightest part of the nebula (a knot at its western edge) is separately classified as NGC 896, because it was the first part of the nebula to be discovered.
