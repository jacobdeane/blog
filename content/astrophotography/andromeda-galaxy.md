The Andromeda Galaxy is a spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light years from Earth. Itâ€™s the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way & contains approximately 1 trillion stars. The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are expected to collide in around 4.5 billion years, merging to form a giant galaxy.

This image was shot in LRGB over two nights in Kendal, UK (Bortle 4) under a 80%+ Moon. 75 2-minute exposures were taken with each filter and the best 57 were used for each channel. Total integration time was 7hrs 36mins. Images were taken with a Altair Hypercam 183M, a William Optics ZS61 on a Losmandy G11 mount. Images were auto-guided with PHD2 and my new dew controller and auto-focus motor from Pegasus Astro worked flawlessly.
