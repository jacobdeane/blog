The Rosette Nebula in Sulphur, Hydrogen Alpha, Oxygen (SHO) My first narrowband image. Talk about a steep learning curve! So much to learn.

This image is a little different to my earlier images because itâ€™s false colour, using special filters to allow very small wavelengths of light through that match the emmisions of Hydrogen alpha, Oxygen III and Sulphur II.

In this image they are mapped as follows: Red: 50% Ha + 50% SII, Green: 50% Ha + 50% OIII, Blue: 85% OIII + 15% Ha. You can see how the gasses are distributed though the Nebula which is quite fascinating!
